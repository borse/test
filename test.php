                     Dreamweaver CS4 has a nice auto-indent feature that helps you write code. It
                     works great with braces but works terribly awful with braces! when I use curly
                     brackets it indents the code up to the beginning of the previous line in a new
                     one, but with the parenthesis it indents it up to the last letter of the
                     previous line in a new line. I rather it happens the same as with braces, any
                     idea how this may work out? in CS3 it worked fine but not for javascript when
